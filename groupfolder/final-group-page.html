         <li>Machine learning involves the use of Artificial intelligence to enable machines to learn a task from experience without programming them specifically about that task.</li>
         (In short, machines learn automatically without human hand holding) 
         <li>This process starts with feeding them good quality data and then training the machines by building various machine learning models using the data and different algorithms.</li>
         <li>The choice of algorithms depends on what type of data we have and what kind of task we are trying to automate. However, generally speaking, Machine Learning Algorithms are divided into 3 types.</li>
         <li>Supervised Machine learning Algorithms,Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms, and Reinforcement Machine Learning Algorithms.</li>

      <p> AI will cause the workforce to evolve</p>
      <p>  
      <li> Will require society to find their passion with new responsibilities that require human abilities </li>
      <li>Projected for about 7.2 million jobs could be created between 2017-2037</li>
      <li> Artificial intelligence will collect more and more data where societyâ€™s privacy becomes compromised </li>
      <li>Such repercussions would devolve into social oppression such as China is doing with its social credit system </li>
      </p>
      <p>Positive impacts of artificial intelligence of society </p>
      <p>
      <li>AI can help improve society on a day to day basis such as improving the efficiency of our workplace</li>
      <li>Free up the human workforce to do work they are better equipped for with tasks involving creativity and empathy among others.</li>
      <li>It will dramatically influence healthcare</li>
      </p>

      <p>Negative impacts of artificial intelligence on society</p>
      <p> 
      <li>AI bias</li>
      <li>Loss of certain jobs</li>
      <li>Shift in Human experience</li>
      <li>Global regulations </li>
      <li>Accelerated hacking</li>
